# Blind Front-End #1
## 18th of February, 2021
With [@ftLoic](https://twitter.com/ftLoic), the challenge was to reproduce [This template](https://html5up.net/spectral), without testing our code anytime before the reveal. Planned to last 30 minutes, we actually took an hour. 
In an hour, without checking what I was doing, I made this:

Disappointing. I forgot one CSS rule and that broke it all. But anyway. We then took another 30 minutes to fix a bit things up. The final result is right here, I didn't try to clean the code, just to make the page look not too shitty. Shitty code is a form of art.
